# Quick Start Guide

## Installation & Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install SafePal Extension
- Open Chrome browser
- Visit: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/safepal-extension-wallet/lgmpcpglpngdoalbgeoldeajfclnhafa
- Click "Add to Chrome"
- Complete initial setup if prompted

### 3. Prepare Your Seed Phrases
Edit `valid.txt` and add your seed phrases (one per line):
```
abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about
test test test test test test test test test test test junk
```

### 4. Run the Script
```bash
# Basic version
python3 safepal_checker.py

# Advanced version (recommended - has better logging)
python3 safepal_checker_advanced.py
```

### 5. Check Results
- Seeds with balance will be saved to `balance.txt`
- Logs are saved to `safepal_checker.log` (advanced version only)

## Two Versions Available

### Basic Version (`safepal_checker.py`)
- Simple and straightforward
- Good for understanding the workflow
- Basic error handling

### Advanced Version (`safepal_checker_advanced.py`) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
- Enhanced error handling
- Detailed logging to file
- Screenshots for debugging
- Multiple detection strategies
- Better UI element detection

## Expected Workflow

1. Script opens Chrome with Selenium
2. For each seed phrase in `valid.txt`:
   - Navigates to SafePal extension
   - Clicks "Add Wallet" ‚Üí "Import Wallet"
   - Selects "Mnemonic phrase"
   - Enters the seed phrase
   - Clicks "Import"
   - Waits for wallet to load
   - Checks for balance
   - If balance > 0: saves to `balance.txt`
   - Moves to next seed
3. Outputs summary

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning
- **NEVER share your seed phrases with anyone**
- Keep `valid.txt` and `balance.txt` secure
- Delete these files after use
- This script is for personal use only

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- SafePal UI may change, requiring script updates
- Balance detection may not be 100% accurate
- You may need to manually remove wallets between runs
- Processing many seeds takes time

### üí° Tips
- Start with 1-2 test seeds to verify it works
- Check the screenshots if balance detection fails
- Review the log file for detailed information
- Manually verify any seeds marked as having balance

## Troubleshooting

### Script can't find buttons
**Problem**: XPath selectors don't match SafePal UI

**Solution**: 
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Inspect the button elements
3. Update the XPath in the script

### Balance not detected
**Problem**: Script reports no balance but wallet has funds

**Solution**:
1. Check the screenshots in the script directory
2. Increase `BALANCE_CHECK_WAIT` in the script
3. Manually verify the balance in SafePal
4. Update balance detection logic if needed

### Extension not loading
**Problem**: Script can't access SafePal extension

**Solution**:
1. Verify extension is installed
2. Check extension ID is correct: `lgmpcpglpngdoalbgeoldeajfclnhafa`
3. Try manually opening: `chrome-extension://lgmpcpglpngdoalbgeoldeajfclnhafa/index.html`
