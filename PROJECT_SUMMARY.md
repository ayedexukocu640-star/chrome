## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.7+** - Programming language
- **Selenium 4.x** - Browser automation framework
- **Chrome WebDriver** - Chrome browser control
- **SafePal Extension** - Cryptocurrency wallet extension

### Supported Features
- 12, 18, and 24-word seed phrases
- Multiple cryptocurrency chains (via SafePal)
- Batch processing of multiple seeds
- Automatic balance detection
- Error recovery and retry logic

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google Chrome browser (latest version)

- 2GB+ RAM recommended

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNINGS:**

1. **Seed Phrase Security**
   - Never share seed phrases with anyone
   - Keep valid.txt and balance.txt encrypted
   - Delete files after use
   - Use on trusted computers only

2. **Network Security**
   - Use secure, private internet connection
   - Avoid public WiFi
   - Consider using VPN for additional privacy

3. **File Security**
   - Secure delete sensitive files after use
   - Don't upload to cloud services
   - Use encrypted storage for backups

4. **Verification**
   - Always manually verify balances
   - Don't trust automated results blindly
   - Cross-check with official wallet apps

## Limitations

⚠️ **Known Limitations:**

1. **UI Dependency** - Script relies on SafePal UI elements which may change
2. **Manual Setup** - SafePal extension must be installed manually
3. **Balance Detection** - May not be 100% accurate, manual verification recommended
4. **Rate Limiting** - Processing many seeds takes time due to blockchain data loading
5. **Wallet Management** - May need to manually remove wallets between runs

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Extension not found | Install SafePal extension, verify extension ID |
| Buttons not clickable | Update XPath selectors in script |
| Balance not detected | Increase wait times, check screenshots |
| Chrome driver error | Update Chrome, reinstall selenium |
| Too many wallets | Manually remove wallets from SafePal |
